## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## ESLint and Prettier Setup (Optional)

To enhance code quality and maintain a consistent coding style, you can set up ESLint and Prettier in your development environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Required Packages:**
   Ensure you have the necessary npm packages installed. Run the following command to install them:

   ```bash
   npm install eslint-config-prettier@^9.1.0 eslint-config-standard@^17.1.0 eslint-plugin-tailwindcss@^3.14.0 --save-dev

## Configure VSCode Settings:

Add the following settings to your project's `.vscode/settings.json` file. Create the file if it doesn't exist:

```json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit",
    "source.addMissingImports": "explicit"
